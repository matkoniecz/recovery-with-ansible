# seriously, who thought that putting the worst part of windows interface into Linux is a good idea?
# if it would be reserved to security updates and popup would be clear about this
# it could be defencible. But modal popup distracting from the current work?
# Just because some of thousands packages I have on my computer released some
# update? Seriously? Why? Why?
